Enable and Configure
Firefox or Mozilla
To configure the Java Plugin follow these steps:

    Exit Firefox browser if it is already running.
    Uninstall any previous installations of Java Plugin.
    Only one Java Plugin can be used at a time. When you want to use a different plugin, or version of a plugin, remove the symbolic links to any other versions and create a fresh symbolic link to the new one.
    Create a symbolic link to the libnpjp2.so file in the browser plugins directory
        Go to the plugins sub-directory under the Firefox installation directory
        cd <Firefox installation directory>/plugins
        Create plugins directory if it does not exist.
        Create the symbolic link
        ln -s <Java installation directory>/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so

    Note: If you are upgrading your Java version then before creating new symbolic link you should remove old symbolic link to enable latest downloaded Java.

    To remove old symbolic link:
    type cd <Firefox installation directory>/plugins
    rm libjavaplugin_oji.so
    Example
        If Firefox is installed at this directory:
        /usr/lib/<Firefox installation directory>
        And if the Java is installed at this directory:
        /usr/java/<Java installation directory>
        Then type in the terminal window to go to the browser plug-in directory:
        /usr/lib/<Firefox installation directory>/plugins
        Enter the following command to create a symbolic link to the Java Plug-in for the Mozilla browser.
        ln -s /usr/java/<Java installation directory>/lib/i386/libnpjp2.so

    Start the Firefox browser, or restart it if it is already up.

    In Firefox, type about:plugins in the Location bar to confirm that the Java Plugin is loaded. You can also click the Tools menu to confirm that Java Console is there.
